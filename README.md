# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
 
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy 
data that can be used for later analysis.  

The following documentation is submitted: 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations that were performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.

## Background and data source.
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

## Project requirement
An R script called run_analysis.R has been created that does the following: 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
